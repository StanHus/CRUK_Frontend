# Hi all, this is my full-stack (React (ts) + postgres-backend)

## Loom video: https://www.loom.com/share/fd27bb1b02ef4f488fdd627d18b65539

## Best feature hands down is that the app's css is highly optimised for mobile, as it is the 18-24 demographic's preferred means of exploration.

## Other Notable Features:
- Clear file tree
- Interactive Quiz
- Forum to share your ideas, contributions, and aspirations
- Pretty css (+- 20% of time spent on it)
- Completion time: 7 hours

## My Limitations
- Not enough time time fro css
- Not enough time for another interactive component
- Not enough time for authentication for the forum

## Ways to Improve
- Authentication
- Another interactive component (poll, another quiz)
- Never too much of css

##### Research includes but is not limited to:

### Looking forward to chatting more about the app and/or the research
